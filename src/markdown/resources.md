### Here are some great resources to help you on your way to fame and fortune!
If you have another gem to share, feel free to message me so I can add them to this list.

### Team and Project Management
#### Github
Git and Github are the defacto standards when it comes to Open Source project collaboration.

#### Project Managment Tools
These tools help you organize your project and team. They are pretty similar so pick the one you like best - you can't
really go wrong with either.

### General Web Development
#### Code Editors
You can't spell Web Developer without "Code Editor" ... well maybe you can but it is still important to pick a suitable
editor once you outgrow the "Codepen" phase and start coding offline. Code editors have come a long way and while still being pretty lightweight offer tons of functionality
rivaling that of full blown IDEs.
Additionally, each of the following programs is free (except Sublime Text but it has an unlimited trial period) and available for any OS
so there's no excuse to not use them. They all have their pros and cons so I will just list them for you to try them out and pick your favorite.

   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

   [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

#### Preprocessing and Live Reloading
One big benefit of Codepen is that it saves you from having to compile your Sass, Less, Pug and CoffeeScript files and even automatically
reloads on changes to your code.
When you take the plunge to offline code editing you don't get this luxury out of the box, but there are ways to have a similar experience.
There's basically 2 ways of doing it: The easy way by using extra programs and the hard way using JS build tools.

##### The Easy Way
Luckily for the beginner dev there's an easy way to accomplish the aforementioned convience by using an additional app that does the heavy lifting for you. 
But beware: As great as those apps are to get you started, in a real dev job you will very likely need to use the "real" JS build tools eventually, so try not
to rely on following for too long.

##### The Hard Way
Build tools are all the rage in the JS community and for good reason. Apart from helping you with compiling your files and autoreloading your browser they help you
automate your build process and development workflow in various ways. No wonder that they're integral part of pretty much any professional dev environment. While there is a certain learning curve to mastering them (especially Webpack) once you get comfortable with them you will wonder how you could live without them before. 
Note that there are more build tools around like Grunt but I feel that only Webpack and gulp are really worth learning at this point.
